These privacy policies explain what data we collect from users and how we use the data we collect.

<br>

## What Data Does Collect
This app is a beta version, so public functions such as photos are limited. Therefore, the only data this app collects is access logs to manage the number of active users. The access log contains a UUID (a string of characters randomly generated only once when the app is installed) and time data. Note that this UUID cannot identify an individual by itself.

<br>

## Deletion Request
Data (photos, signs or billboards) registered by users can be deleted from the app only by the registered users themselves.    

If you have any requests to delete data registered by other users. Please contact us via the "Contact Us" in the app. When contacting us with a deletion request, please attach a copy of the UUID, etc. of the relevant data. We will consider the request and take action such as deleting the data.
