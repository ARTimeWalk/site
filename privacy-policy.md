These privacy policies explain what data we collect from users and how we use the data we collect.

<br>

### What Data Does Collect
This app, now in its beta version, collects the following types of data:

- **User-uploaded image data**: This includes landscape photos or images of signs or billboards. When sharing these images, please be mindful of the rights and privacy of individuals, objects, and buildings depicted in the photos.

- **GNSS-derived latitude and longitude**: This data is used to indicate the location of signs or billboards. The latitude and longitude are obtained from GNSS at the time the subject is captured.

- **Spatial tracking location data**: This uses visual markers for accurate positioning based on camera input and motion sensor data. This data is utilized in calculations when presenting photos in AR.

- **Access logs**: These include a UUID (a randomly generated string assigned upon installation) along with time data. Please note that the UUID cannot be used to identify an individual by itself.

<br>

### Deletion Request
Data (photos, signs or billboards) registered by users can be deleted from the app only by the registered users themselves.

If you have any requests to delete data registered by other users. Please contact us via the "Contact Us" in the app. When contacting us with a deletion request, please attach a copy of the UUID, etc. of the relevant data. We will consider the request and take action such as deleting the data.
